        db_server: The `db_server` parameter refers to the server where the database is hosted. This could
        be an IP address or a domain name pointing to the server where the SQL Server instance is running.
        db_name: The `db_name` parameter in the `get_db_connection` function refers to the name of the
        database you want to connect to on the specified database server. This parameter is used to
        construct the connection string that includes information such as the database name, server details,
        user credentials, and driver information for
        db_user: The `db_user` parameter in the `get_db_connection` function refers to the username used
        to authenticate and access the database. It is typically associated with a specific user account
        that has the necessary permissions to interact with the database specified by `db_name` on the
        server `db_server`.

        object should be a serializable format that can be stored in a database column, typically a string
        representation of the
        submit_time: Submit time is the timestamp when the request was submitted to the API. It typically
        includes the date and time when the request was made.
        response_time: Response time is the time taken for the server to process a request and send a
        response back to the client. It is usually measured in milliseconds and indicates the efficiency of
        the system in handling requests.
        cost: The `cost` parameter in the `write_to_db` function represents the total cost associated with
        the API interaction being recorded in the database. This cost could be related to any expenses
        incurred during the interaction, such as processing fees, data storage costs, or any other relevant
        expenses. It is a numerical
